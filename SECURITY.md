# Security Policy


## Supported branches
We aim to support the latest `main` and the last two minor release branches.


## Reporting a vulnerability
Email **security@[YOUR‑DOMAIN]** with details and a PoC if available.
We’ll acknowledge in 3 business days, triage within 7, and coordinate a private fix & release before disclosure.


## Secret hygiene
- Use GitHub **Org/Repo Secrets** and **Environments**.
- Never commit tokens; enable **secret scanning** & **push protection**.
